    "## FINAL REFLECTION: The recent team teaches has helped me understand and learn new concepts that are clearly tested on the collegeboard practice exams. Taking a practice exam last trimester to this trimester showed signficant improvement as I learned new concepts and its applications. The areas that I'm not as familiar with are binary and AND/OR statements as I have less experience with it. To improve my score I need to have more practice and familiarity with the format of the questions and what the intention of the question is. If watch some collegeboard videos regarding these topics I will have formed a better understanding of these areas and hopefully will allow me to perform even better."

## Questions Wrong
- 14 and 41

## Notes and specifics
- Loop Algorithms
    - Correct answer was C
    - Analyze the time complexity of the algorithms in terms of the big O notation
    - Compare the worst-case, best-case, and average-case scenarios to understand how the algorithms perform under different conditions

- Implement and apply an algorithm
    - Correct answer was B
    -  Gain a clear understanding of the problem or task that needs to be solved
    - Define the problem statement, input, and expected output
    - Choose an appropriate algorithm: Select an algorithm that best suits the requirements of the problem
    - Consider the time complexity, space complexity, and other relevant factors to ensure the chosen algorithm is efficient and effective

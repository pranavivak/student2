## Final Project Plan: Algorithms and Minesweeper

### Project Overview:

- Develop a Minesweeper algorithm to generate and solve puzzles.
- Enhance interactivity and visual appeal of the game.

### Setup:

- Create tables for Minesweeper boards, user data, and game states using SQLAlchemy.
- Write scripts to create and initialize the database schema.

### Backend Development:

- Implement an algorithm to generate valid Minesweeper boards with random mine placement.
- Store generated boards in the database.
- Implement an algorithm for solving Minesweeper puzzles.
- Enable user interaction with the Minesweeper grid, including revealing cells, flagging mines, and submitting moves for solving.

### Algorithms:

- Generate a list of potential mine locations and ensure a valid board setup.
- Calculate the number of adjacent mines for each cell.
- Develop logic for uncovering cells and propagating reveals when a cell with no adjacent mines is uncovered.

### Database Interaction:

- Utilize SQLAlchemy for sorting and searching operations.
- Analyze and document the time and space complexity of the Minesweeper solving algorithm.

### Grid Manipulation:

- Perform 2D iteration to validate and manipulate the Minesweeper grid.

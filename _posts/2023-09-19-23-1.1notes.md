## Interpersonal skills learned through collaboration:
- communication
- consesus building
- conflict resolution
- negotiation

## How to collaborate in class
- Pair programming
    - two programmers work together as a pair
    - one writes program code while the other reveiws each line of program as it is typed in
- Think-Pair-Share
    - students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class
- communicate with your team
- communicate with yourself
- acknowledge code segments used from other sources
- acknowledge media used from other sources
- differentiate what you and your partners did
- clarify the functionality of your code

we will have the scrum master create a scrum board on github and keep track of each of the team members tasks and give due dates for things like review tickets that need to be completed

    "    - TLS (see HTTPS section)\n",
    "    - USB (permits data exchange between electronics)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Telnet is a internet protocol which allows remote access to other computers over a local network or the internet. What layer of the OSI model would this protocol be located on? What is the function of this layer?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DNS\n",
    "\n",

    " - What are some cons of this protocol? Give an example of a potential issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. TCP has error checking, which ensures that all packets arrive properly. Why is this important?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " - Give an example of how TCP ensures that there are no errors.\n",

    "3. Server A computer is communicating with Server B. They have already initiated communication and Server A is now attempting to send data to Server B.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " - How does Server B ensure that they have received any sent packets before Server A continues sending packets in TCP? In UDP?\n",

### What We Accomplished
- made schedule in lab notebook
- added games like 'snake game' and 'game of life'
- then explored on our own and added various other games
- cloned student repository to have only the Compsci menu, and not the csse, csp, and csa
- learned how to add posts to the lab notebook
- added a pink table for favorite songs

### Problems
- accidently made changes in github and then made changes in vscode without pulling from github
    - this caused problems as I kept comitting

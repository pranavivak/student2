## Write Up

In our Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) class, we embarked on an insightful journey delving into various aspects of computer science, ranging from data management to frontend interactions. Throughout our exploration, we employed a myriad of tools and techniques to understand and apply fundamental concepts, enhancing our comprehension of key principles in the field.

Collections:
Our journey commenced with the exploration of collections, where we delved into the realm of database management using SQLite. Leveraging Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and SQLite3 Editor, we meticulously crafted tables to organize our data effectively. Within our database, we meticulously structured our collections, ensuring seamless access and management of information. Through the implementation of Python models, we not only initialized tables but also populated them with test data, facilitating comprehensive testing and validation of our database architecture.

Lists and Dictionaries:

Next, we transitioned into the realm of lists and dictionaries, harnessing their power in Python APIs. With the aid of debuggers in VSCode, we extracted data from our database, seamlessly converting them into Python objects for further manipulation. Additionally, we meticulously crafted dictionaries, showcasing distinct examples of key-value pairs and elucidating their significance in data organization and retrieval.

APIs and JSON:

Our exploration further extended into the realm of APIs and JSON, where we crafted robust Python API codes capable of handling diverse HTTP requests. Leveraging Postman, we meticulously tested our APIs, validating their efficacy in responding to various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, and UPDATE. Through algorithmic conditions, we directed requests to the appropriate Python methods, ensuring streamlined data processing and manipulation. Furthermore, we implemented stringent validation protocols to authenticate and sanitize data, mitigating potential security risks and ensuring data integrity.

Frontend:

In the culmination of our journey, we ventured into frontend development, harnessing JavaScript APIs to fetch data and dynamically format JSON objects. Through Chrome Inspect, we scrutinized responses from our fetch requests, meticulously formatting JSON data into user-friendly displays. Leveraging JavaScript, we orchestrated the iteration and formatting of data into HTML, enhancing user experience and interactivity. Additionally, we demonstrated the seamless interaction between frontend and backend systems, showcasing the retrieval and submission of data through POST and UPDATE methods, accompanied by robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage success and failure scenarios.

Optional/Extra: Algorithm Analysis:

As an optional endeavor, we delved into algorithm analysis, exploring methodologies for data preparation and predictive modeling. Through meticulous data cleaning, encoding, and one-hot encoding techniques, we curated datasets primed for predictive analysis. Additionally, we delved into the intricacies of Linear Regression and Decision Tree algorithms, elucidating their underlying principles and applications in predictive modeling.

In conclusion, our journey in AP CSP has been a testament to the multifaceted nature of computer science, encompassing data management, API development, frontend interactions, and algorithm analysis. Through hands-on exploration and experimentation, we've not only honed our technical skills but also cultivated a deeper appreciation for the diverse applications of computer science in our modern world.

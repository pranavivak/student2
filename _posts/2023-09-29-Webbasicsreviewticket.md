## Utterances
- Based on the Utterances and the peer reveiwers, we had a collective score of 2.5
- this means that we received a full score on each part but we didn't have utterances because we weren't sure what those were and our class wasn't taught it 
- My vscode was being weird yesterday, however today, the Explorer button showed up again and so did all the work I did

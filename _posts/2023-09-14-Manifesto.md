## Manifesto
- We value collaboration and teamwork, knowing that learning is enhanced when we work together, ask questions, and help one another.
- We adapt our strategies and solutions based on changing requirements from our instructors.
- We strive for simplicity in our code and solutions, believing that straightforward solutions are often the most effective. 
- We embrace an iterative approach to problem-solving, seeking feedback and refinement at each step.
- We stay flexible in our approach to problem-solving, willing to pivot when necessary.
- We prioritize writing, testing, and refining actual code, understanding that practical experience is the best teacher.
- We communicate with peers and instructors to gather insights, requirements, and feedback for building better solutions.
- We emphasize understanding concepts, problem-solving, and continuous learning rather than memorizing facts and algorithms.
- We take ownership of our learning and projects, setting our goals, priorities, and deadlines, and being accountable for our progress.
- We focus on delivering working solutions that meet and go beyond the requirements while also not striving for perfection.
- We prioritize a working community, mutual support, and helping each other succeed.
- We aim for high-quality code, seeking mastery in the principles and practices of computer science.

## Art Global Project Plan
With our project, we seek to create a search engine where viewers can type in different locations to find all sorts of art museums closest to them. We also want to include profiles of famous artists and styles to give them an idea of what kind of art they would be most interested in visiting.

## Background
The four of us have a passion for art and we would love for others to get to know more about this amazing world.

## Initial Concepts:

### Katelyn (Scrum Master):
- Create profiles for the different art periods
- Make the website visually appealing
- Profiles of different well-known artists should be similar to Spotifyâ€™s profiles
- Introduce and explain the history of art to non-artists

### Ellie (Frontend):
- Each art era could have a different color or stickers that are fitting
- Artists of each period should have coordinating colors or visuals in some way to its respective period
- Artist profiles could have:
- Images of works
    - Birthyear -> death of artist
    - Art Period
    - Most famous piece
    - Impact/Influences
    - Brief bio

### Pranavi (DevOps)
- Create a database containing information about art museums worldwide, including their locations, opening hours, exhibit details, and visitor reviews
- Implement geolocation functionality to allow users to search for museums near their current location or specify a location
- Enable advanced search filters to refine results by features like museum type, collections, and accessibility
- Integrate interactive maps to display museum locations
